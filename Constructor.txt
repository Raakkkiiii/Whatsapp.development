CONSTRUCTOR:
           * Constructor is a special method in c++.

           * Class name and function(constructor) name will be same.

           * There is no return type(void) for constructor.

           * We can't make abstract reference to constructor.

           * When we create an object for a class the default 
             constructor will  get called automatically.

           * It supports method(or)function overloading and doesn't
              support method(or)function overriding.

Types of Constructor:

            1. Default constructor / Non- parameterized.
            2. Parameterized.
    
Copy Constructor:
        * A copy constructor is a member function that initializies an object using another object of the same class.

Destructor:
           * Destructor name should be same as class name prefixed with tilde(~) operator.
           * It should be public.
           * It doesn't contains arguments, never contains return type(void).
           * It will be called automatically when the object goes out of the scope.
